# OSDEV-resources
## Organization
Each resource should be inserted into one of the final layers according to the topic, if possible.
The final layers will be broken down into official channels, documents, articles, books, talks, and courses each of which will be separated into a free and paid list individually.
If a folder is too cluttered, trying to further separate the topics should be attempted.
